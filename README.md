# Minimum Weighted Completion Times

This is a classic greedy algorithms example problem which 
aims to minimize the weighted completion times of a list of jobs.

Two potential greedy algorithms are compared. The first orders the jobs
by the difference (weight - length) and the second (optimal) orders
the jobs by the ratio weight/length.
